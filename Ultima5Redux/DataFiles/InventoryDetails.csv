No good person begrudges the vanquisher a monster's gold and good, but evil creatures often arm their chests with deadly traps. Popular chest traps are acid sprays, poison fumes, bombs and gaseous atmospheres. The first two are designed with intent to destroy the individual tampering with the lock. The last two a affect the entire area of the chest and injure anyone in that area. An Sanct used blood moss and sulphurous ash to seep into hidden traps and render them impotent.

Rotted corpses and corrupted spirits, given motion and a semblance of life, are set on the mindless destruction of everything good. Such phantoms are not living but are merely animated. They act mindlessly, unaware of their own horrible state. By negating their armour of mindlessness, An Xen Corp causes most risen dead to flee in lurching terror.

Nasty or not, these summoned beasts are always loyal to the caster, and often direct a foe's attention away from members of the mage's party.

Spell,Vas_Flam,Vas Flam,260,260,"Vas Flam effectively gathers a great ball of flame, which may then be hurled at a foe. A simple spell, the great advantage of Vas Flam is that, aimed accurately, it will surely hit its mark and, just as surely, inflict damage.

In Flam Grav causes the particular spot indicated by the caster to erupt into red hot flames. Any creature on that spot or that steps into that spot is seared by a wall of flame.

Sulphurous ash and black pearl project the burning fire to the chosen spot; spider silk holds it there a short while. The mix works best when blended over a flame.",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
Spell,In_Nox_Grav,In Nox Grav,260,260,"Another of the three energy field spells, In Nox Grav causes a cloud of nauseating poison to occur in the location indicated. Any creatures entering the cloud suffer some degree of poisoning. Like In Flam Grav, this spell can be just as effective in harming friends as enemies, so use care. That rare but deadly poison, nightshade, is required for In Nox Grav. Add spider silk to shape the cloud, and black pearl to direct its placement.",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
Spell,In_Zu_Grav,In Zu Grav,260,260,"Least damaging of the three energy field spells, In Zu Grav is often the most effective. The spell cloaks a foe in purple haze that puts it instantly to sleep, taking it out of the fight, rendering it helpless. Like the other two similar spells, In Zu Grav can affect friends as easily as enemies. While sleep will not directly harm friends, falling asleep on the field of battle can be deadly. In Zu Grav is easily mixed of common ginseng, spider silk and black pearl. For best results, add the air of many yawns and sand from sleepy eyes.",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
Spell,In_Por,In Por,260,260,"In Por teleports an entire party a fair distance in any specified direction. However, incanting this spell during the haste of battle will diminish its effects. It will only remove the caster, and then only to another place on the battlefield. In Por will not transport a party if there is no clear, grassy spot to which the party can be moved. Nor will In Por work in dungeons or in townes, as its energies require a fair bit of open space to operate. The dust for In Por consists of spider silk and fresh young blood moss. The caster must close his eyes and conjure a vision of the current position after the party has left. In a wink, the party will be elsewhere and the vision, reality.",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
Spell,An_Grav,An Grav,260,260,Adventuring parties are sometimes prevented from pursuing their objective by obstructing or noxious fields. An Grav removes the obstructing field by negating the field's energy. Ash countermines the field's energy; a black pearl thrusts the negating energy in the direction indicated by the spell caster. The obstructing field is instantly dispersed.,The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
Spell,In_Sanct,In Sanct,260,260,"Sometimes young questers join in battles beyond their might. In Sanct helps balance the fight by creating a protective shield around each party member. In Sanct works only during combat and does not last long, so knights should be sure to hit hard and fast while the iron is doubled. In Sanct is most effective when sulphurous ash, fast-working ginseng, and reeking garlic are mixed by the mage and the group's strongest fighter, simultaneously.",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
Spell,In_Sanct_Grav,In Sanct Grav,260,260,"In Sanct Grav's protective energy provides a strong defense. Its shimmering blueness cannot be entered or passed through. An excellent recourse when a few moments of safety are required, In Sanct Grav is well used to block dungeon corridors fully. Mandrake root is necessary for In Sanct Grav; choose older, tougher specimens for this concoction. Add spider silk to make it impenetrable and black pearl for placement.",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
Spell,Uus_Por,Uus Por,260,260,"Magic users often travel with courageous groups, and courageous groups often find themselves in danger. When problems occur within dungeons, it is sometimes helpful to use Des Por and its complement Uus Por for moving among floors. Only effective when going from empty corridor to empty corridor, Des Por transports an entire group to the exact same location one floor lower, Uus Por works in reverse and transports upward. Unfortunately, these spells take too long to intone during the heat of battle.

It is glazed, dried in the sun, then crystallized into a shiny powder that must be tossed in the sky over the field of battle as the spell is cast.",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
Spell,In_Bet_Xen,In Bet Xen,260,260,"This combat spell creates a powerful ally by calling up four swarms of small but deadly insects. All four swarms are generated in the same location. However, each can be commanded to move independently and on its own turn. Quartets of insect swarms generated by In Bet Xen have been known to surround and suffocate an enemy by their very number. The powder for In bet Xen consists of sulphurous ash to give life energy, blood moss to set them swarming, and spider silk to bind the swarm in obedience. For deadliest results, blend with stagnant water from the dankest swamp.",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
Spell,An_Ex_Por,An Ex Por,260,260,"The magical locking of doors works in nearly every situation. Even normal locks can be transformed into magical locks by means of this spell. Thus the very creature who initially locked a door with its own key may be forbidden access. Mix ash and moss, gathered from darkest glens under heavy clouds, into a strong garlic paste. While mixing, sing a melody that no other creature has every heard. For greatest security, the melody should be different each mixing; so each magical lock will require a subtly different magical key, and anyone trying to break the magical lock will not be able to use any previously discovered keys.",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
Spell,In_Ex_Por,In Ex Por,260,260,"This powerful spell can open magical locks. The power of In Ex Por is that it first analyzes the lock to be broken and then actually produces the precise tool or magical potion that will break the lock. The success of this spell comes from combining ash and moss in isolation, in complete darkness.",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
Spell,Vas_Mani,Vas Mani,260,260,"Whole health restored; full vitality given; such is the nature of Vas Mani. A miraculous spell requiring concentration and vast knowledge of anatomy, Vas Mani is reserved for experience mages. Vas Mani fully restores patients from combat wounds. While it provides neither antidote to poison nor cure for disease, Vas Mani does heal all damage wrought by these ravagers, ensuring survival until a cure can be found. The difficulty in preparing Vas Mani is in locating the mandrake root; otherwise the preparation is straightforward; mix the mandrake root with ginseng and spider silk. To cast Vas Mani successfully, the caster must concentrate totally on the subject to be healed. When the concentration is full, one can actually see wounds heal. Because the healing process can take several hours, Vas Mani cannot be used during combat.",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
Spell,In_Zu,In Zu,260,260,"The first mass effect spell the developing magician learns, In Zu causes the scent of poppies to emanate from the caster in an ever-widening wedge, dropping into a sound of sleep all those touched by it. Only the toughest minds and wills may deny it. Nightshade, gathered when high tide coincides with a moonless midnight, must be mixed with ocean ginseng and spider silk. Moisten with brine and add sand to mix thoroughly. Lay to dry in bright moonlight. Note that this spell is just as effective on friend as foe; aim carefully.",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
Spell,Rel_Tym,Rel Tym,260,260," Rel Tym doubles a party's speed, anytime, anywhere. It is especially effective in battle, when a party's members can return two blows for each of the enemies blows. It is also effective in surveillance, when being caught could be disastrous.

Spell,In_Vas_Por_Ylem,In Vas Por Ylem,260,260,"In Vas Por Ylem is a terrifying spell that can generate a massive earthquake. While it reaches every enemy in combat, even if lurking in distant corners or behind mountains, the magical earthquake leaves allies unshaken and unharmed. Seek mandrake root that has grown unobstructed, so that its form is string yet fibrous. Grind it with sulphurous ash and blood moss until no ingredient can be distinguished from another.",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
Spell,Quas_An_Wis,Quas An Wis,260,260,"Quas An Wis turns a foe's orderly, well-planned attack into bedlam. Confusion reigns and creatures strike out at whomever is nearest, regardless of loyalty. Extremely effective against the likes of rats and Orcs, Quas An Wis loses much of its impact against more intelligent monsters, which are often capable of recognizing and resisting it. A mix of rare mandrake root and nightshade, the cloud of Quas An Wis works only for experienced mages.",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
Spell,In_An,In An,260,260,"In An creates an air of magical negation. Spells fizzle when In An is in effect and neither side in combat can use magic for several rounds. First, mandrake root must be gathered; the root must be rubbed with garlic and wrapped in a damp, black cloth for several hours. At midnight, it must be pulverized and mixed with sulphurous ash. The mixture must be dried on parchment and the parchment then folded into a tricorn. In casting the spell, a hole must be cut in the tricorn and the mixture dispensed from this in a wide arc.",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
Spell,Wis_An_Ylem,Wis An Ylem,260,260,"Adept magicians are relied upon, not only to aid in battle and to repair wounds, but to guide their party wisely. Wis An Ylem provides the necessary insight, by making the hidden apparent. For an instant, the caster may see through the densest forest, tallest mountain and most solid rock. No wall can be too thick, no door too heavy. Requiring intensity of concentration, Wis An Ylem cannot be maintained for more than a flash of time. Thick, mature mandrake root must be combined with sulphurous ash in clear rain water. Boil the mixture until it becomes steam and capture the steam in a small glass box. Open the box as the spell is uttered.",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
Spell,An_Xen_Ex,An Xen Ex,260,260,"A most effective tactic to use against enemies is to charm members of their party to work against them. However, this spell is most difficult to apply where it could be of the most help, against the most diabolical of foes, those of superior intelligence. Control of a charmed individual is limited to fighting and moving; it does not extend to use of magic or special forms of attack. This spell can also be used to bring back party members after they have been charmed by a foe.
An Xen Ex requires a careful mixture of nightshade, to poison the mind; a black pearl, for projection; and spider silk to bind loyalty",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)

Speak without moving lips.",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
Spell,Xen_Corp,Xen Corp,260,260,"Regardless of the strength, size or endurance of a foe, Xen Corp will overcome it. Only a creature with intelligence capable of greater concentration than that used in the casting, and capable of recognizing the intent before the spell is completed, has a chance of escaping death when assailed by Xen Corp.

While intoning the spell, hurl the capsule at the foe selected for destruction.",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
Spell,In_Quas_Xen,In Quas Xen,260,260,"Another powerful combat spell is In Quas Xen. By means of illusion, this spell duplicates friend or foe, in every detail. Although the new creature is an illusion, it fights and bleeds exactly as the original. When a friend is cloned, the original and duplicates are still joined. Injury to each is felt by the other, death to one destroys the other. Yet the two are physically separate; they have independent turns in battle and may work together to vanquish a foe. When a hostile creature is duplicated, no connection between copy and original seems to remain. Pain to a monster's clone is not felt by the monster; and death of the creature does not remove the clone. The power of mandrake root is essential to this spell; as are the illusionary properties of nightshade. To mature the root, add spider silk to bind and ginseng to heal; mix with the living energy of sulphurous ash and add blood moss for animation. When casting the spell, fling the glittering sand that results into the air. The wind will catch the granules, and where the first one touches earth, there shall the clone arise.",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
Spell,In_Quas_Wis,In Quas Wis,260,260,"Travelers in Britannia tell of magical gems that transport the vision of one gazing into their depths to a viewpoint thousands of feet above the land, like that of an eagle suspended in flight. It is illusion and reality. The change of viewpoint is illusion, but the knowledge provided is real. Powerful mages can replicate these miraculous effects through magic. In Quas Wis requires only two ingredients to create its illusion. Only the most powerful mandrake root will work for this spell; and only the most convoluted stems of nightshade. Mix the two in the dark of night with seven drops of cold spring water. Let the moisture evaporate, then place the shimmering powder in a cloth sack. When intoning In Quas Wis, cast the powder high to view the world about as if from the air. If cast within a towne, building or dungeon, all the detail of that level is revealed.",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
Spell,In_Nox_Hur,In Nor Hur,260,260,"A cone of poisonous wind emanates from the hands of an agile wizard when in Nox Hur is cast, widening as it moves forward and sickening all in its path, friend or foe. Quite effective against many kinds of creatures, In Nox Hur is dangerous to use since the slightest error can destroy comrades as well as foes. Only the most dexterous should attempt it",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
Spell,In_Quas_Corp,In Quas Corp,260,260,"Illusion is a dangerous tool, and In Quas Corp creates a powerful illusion. Suddenly, in the eyes of all creatures not intelligent enough to recognize the illusion, each party member may be made to appear as a twelve-foot giant, with a sword like a guillotine and a staff like a tree trunk. Fear strikes foes to the cores of their beings. They shriek and flee. In Quas Corp is expensive. The dust that must fill the atmosphere as the spell is cast contains both mandrake root and hallucinatory nightshade. Simple garlic adds to the distastefulness of the experience for the foe.",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
Spell,In_Mani_Corp,In Mani Corp,260,260,"There are many rewards for hard work and concentrated practice. For practiced wizards, having attained the eighth circle, there is the reward of being able to reverse death itself. Resurrection requires such total concentration and peace of mind that it should never be attempted on the harried field of battle. To mix, place a mandrake root in a sieve in a fresh water spring on a sunlit day. One by one, add garlic, to keep away ills and evil, spider silk, for binding the life forces together, ginseng for healing, sulphurous ash for the spark of life, and blood moss to animate the spirit. Remove the sieve from the spring and let the mixture dry. A small crystal will form from the drying mass. To revive a companion, place the crystal on the friend's forehead and intone In Mani Corp. The resurrected person will be weak and in need of further assistance.",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
Spell,Kal_Xen_Corp,Kal Xen Corp,260,260,"Kal Xen Corp resembles Kal Xen, but its summons has far greater complexity and power. Kal Xen Corp calls forth a daemon. But only an experienced wizard is able to devote the concentration needed to bind the daemon's allegiance and prevent it from turning on his party. Then, although the daemon cannot use its own powers of possession, it can hurl great balls of fire across long distance to smite foes. Mandrake root, gathered as near as possible to an entrance to dungeons, pits, and other vile holes, is the base of this spell. Add garlic, blood moss and the strongest spider silk. Mix the lot together letting the moisture of the root act as a binding. Now shape the mixture into the form of the winged daemon. Raise the icon to the sky, into this spell and hear it calling its own.",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
Spell,In_Vas_Grav_Corp,In Vas Grav Corp,260,260,"In Vas Grav Corp is the most powerful instrument of death yet devised. This spell lays waste to every living creature in its path unless the creature be exempt from the natural laws of this world or be strong enough intellect to resist the spell. Mandrake root must be gathered on a dark night during a lightning storm. It must be marinated in slime from stagnant mosquito fens and wrapped in nightshade, which must have been picked at midnight in total darkness. This package should be rolled in sulphurous ash and left on a grave overnight. If it is not discovered, it is ready to be dried into stringy dreadlocks of death.",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
Spell,In_Flam_Hur,In Flam Hur,260,260,"In Flam Hur causes the wind itself to catch fire and devastate all in its path. Those who intone this spell can direct the flaming wind in a deadly spreading wedge. All creatures in the path of this wedge are severely burned; few ever survive. Careless misdirection of In Flam Hur over one's own companions may result in their deaths as well. Sulphurous ash, blood moss and mandrake root combine best for this spell in an iron cauldron over great heat.",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
Spell,Vas_Rel_Por,Vas Rel Por,260,260,"A moongate traveler cannot rely on magic alone. The knowledge of the influence of the moon's phases is also required. Take a black pearl and shine it well. Bury the pearl in a clean piece of mandrake root. Sprinkle the whole with sulphurous ash and expose the conglomeration to the moons during one night. In the morning it will be a fine silver powder. To travel, cast the powder in the direction of the gate to be reached while speaking the name of that gate's town followed by Vas Rel Por. Immediately drop to the ground and meditate on the proper phases of the moon for that gate. Instantly, the party will be there.",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
Spell,An_Tym,An Tym,260,260,"Perhaps the most difficult of spells, An Tym appears to stop time itself. For eons, scholars of thaumaturgy have tried to learn the secret of controlling the universe, and the more they discovered, the more convinced they became that they could never control this power even if they understood it. It is a tribute to the brilliance and creativity of Britannian minds that experts, undaunted by their failures, simply turned the problem around and found a way to achieve every advantage of briefly controlling time without actually controlling it at all. Those capable of this spell will witness their foes paralyzed in mid-motion. After a few moments, all returns to normal, just as though time had actually stopped and started up again. However, the caster's party remains active throughout the spell. An Tym requires a mixture of mandrake root, well-preserved blood moss and a garlic clove.",The Book of Lore (Ultima V)
