It is illusion and reality. The change of viewpoint is illusion, but the knowledge provided is real. Powerful mages can replicate these miraculous effects through magic. In Quas Wis requires only two ingredients to create its illusion. Only the most powerful mandrake root will work for this spell; and only the most convoluted stems of nightshade. Mix the two in the dark of night with seven drops of cold spring water. Let the moisture evaporate, then place the shimmering powder in a cloth sack. When intoning In Quas Wis, cast the powder high to view the world about as if from the air. If cast within a towne, building or dungeon, all the detail of that level is revealed.",

Mandrake root, gathered as near as possible to an entrance to dungeons, pits, and other vile holes, is the base of this spell. Add garlic, blood moss and the strongest spider silk.

Those capable of this spell will witness their foes paralyzed in mid-motion. After a few moments, all returns to normal, just as though time had actually stopped and started up again. However, the caster's party remains active throughout the spell. An Tym requires a mixture of mandrake root, well-preserved blood moss and a garlic clove.",
